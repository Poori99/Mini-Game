# Mini-Game

## JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors mini-game! 
This simple project showcases the classic game where players choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined based on the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.\
The core of this Rock, Paper, Scissors mini-game lies in the JavaScript file. The game logic is designed for a console-based experience, where the computer randomly generates a move and compares it with the user's input. \
